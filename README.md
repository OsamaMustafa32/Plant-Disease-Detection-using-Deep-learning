# Plant-Disease-Detecttion-using-Deep-learning
To monitor and detect the conditions of these plants i have tested models from Machine Learning algorithms on a dataset of namely three categories or classes (healthy, powdery, rusty) with highest observable accuracies. Two types of algorithms are tested namely CNN and TL (Xception Model) algorithms and the analysis is made with accuracies.
